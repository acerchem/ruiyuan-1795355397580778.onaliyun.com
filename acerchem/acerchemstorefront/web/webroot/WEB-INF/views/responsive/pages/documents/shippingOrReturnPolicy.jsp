					I4U ships same day on required delivery date on order before 12:00pm Pacific Time Monday - Friday. Delivery typically takes 3-7 business days for standard shipping.<br/><br/>

					Orders placed during weekends or holidays will be processed the following business day - all orders should ship out within 24 hours. This excludes special order and out of stock products. Also note that I4U attempts to ship orders 100% complete (partial orders are rare, except in situations of out of stock products).<br/><br/>
					
					Rural areas may take additional time to receive our shipments. Additional charges will be applied if the delivery address is incorrect, or if the package needs to be forwarded to a different location.<br/><br/>
					
					If your order is returned to us due to a banned/restricted products policy, a wrong address, refusal to pay customs fees, refusal to accept the order or because no one was there to accept delivery of your order, we will refund your credit card as follows: You will be refunded the total amount of the order, minus the shipping charge, and 20% of the value of the order, (as a re-stocking fee). We will also subtract any other outside charges I4U has incurred during shipping, such as warehousing fees, return postage fees, etc.<br/><br/>
					
					If the cost to return the product to us is larger than the cost of the refund due, we will instruct the carrier to abandon the order and there will be no credit for the order. If the product(s) is seized by customs, there will be no credit processed for the product(s).<br/><br/>
